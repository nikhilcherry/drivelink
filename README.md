DriveLink
Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Operating System

DriveLink is a next-generation Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication operating system designed to enable real-time intent sharing, trajectory prediction, and cooperative mobility between vehicles. It adds the missing communication layer on top of modern sensor systems, making transportation significantly safer, smoother, and more efficient.

Introduction

Modern vehicles rely heavily on sensors such as cameras, radar, and lidar. These systems allow cars to see the environment but do not allow them to communicate with one another. As a result, vehicles frequently react after danger appears.

DriveLink changes this paradigm.
It allows vehicles to broadcast their immediate intent and predicted motion to nearby cars, enabling proactive, cooperative driving.

Core Capabilities

Vehicle Understanding
Reads vehicle parameters including speed, steering, braking, and acceleration to understand real-time behavior.

Prediction Engine
Generates short time-window trajectory predictions to anticipate where the vehicle will be in the next second(s).

Low-Latency V2V Communication
Communicates predicted motion and intent with nearby vehicles in under 50 milliseconds, enabling instantaneous cooperative reactions.

Why DriveLink Matters

Reduces blind-spot and lane-change collisions

Eliminates unnecessary braking cascades (traffic waves)

Enables smooth merging and coordinated lane behavior

Supports next-generation autonomous driving systems

Provides a foundational communication standard for fleets and smart cities

DriveLink positions itself as a universal standard for mobility communication.

Target Segments

Electric vehicle fleets

Automotive OEMs

Smart city mobility programs

Autonomous R&D labs

Architecture Overview

DriveLink consists of three layers:

On-Vehicle Module
Lightweight hardware module + embedded software that reads vehicle data and performs local prediction.

DriveLink Protocol
A low-latency V2V message standard designed for intent-first communication.

Intelligence Layer
Scalable software providing analytics, conflict zone detection, and safety insights across networks of vehicles.

Business Model

DriveLink uses a hybrid revenue model:

Fleet SaaS (per-vehicle subscription)

OEM per-vehicle licensing

Smart city infrastructure contracts

Data analytics revenue streams (intent heatmaps, conflict maps, optimization insights)

Founding Story

DriveLink began on November 10 when the founding team identified a critical gap in modern transportation: vehicles operate as isolated agents, unable to communicate intent. This inspired the creation of a cooperative intelligence layer for mobility.

Early validation and guidance came from PedalStart mentors:

Harsirjan Kour

Sayanee Bhowmik

Industry insights were provided by the CEO of Simple Energy.

On November 26, the team created its first investor-ready pitch deck and presented it to Debasis Chakraborty (CEO, Dariaan Consulting). The team is actively engaged with Simple Energy, automotive automation experts, and GHAT Section Safe Mobility.

Team

CEO & Chief Systems Architect — Hruday
